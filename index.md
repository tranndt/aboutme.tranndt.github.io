## <center>RELEVANT EXPERIENCE</center>
**Research Assistant – Undergraduate Summer Research Award (Co-op Work Term 1)**| *May 2021 - Aug 2021*
Database and Data Mining Laboratory, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Manitoba
*Supervised by Dr. Carson Leung.*
 - As a team of three, awarded 1st place in the scheduling challenge presented by Bison Transport during the Nexus Data Challenge 2021. Solution consisted of a novel load balancing scheduling algorithm, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network that can predict the future load. 
- Developed a special Neural Network called an auto-encoder using PyTorch that works with health data (COVID-19, breast cancer). The auto-encoder offers an 8% improvement to traditional Machine Learning models in terms of F1 score, and 10% using our derived metric.

**Research Assistant – Undergraduate Research Award** | *May 2020 - Aug 2020*
Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba
*Supervised by Dr. Mike Domaratzki.*
- Modeled datasets that are highly imbalanced using Machine Learning techniques. Implemented oversampling tools to overcome challenges presented by such imbalance for a multi-class dataset (credit card activities), as well as experimented with new solutions for a continuous dataset (corn yield). Overall achieved an average increase of 8% in R2 regression score with the use of imbalanced sampling tools and other supporting methods.
